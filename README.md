# SMX-Elevator
SMX Elevator Project
Program reads in inputs from Input.csv (each input is a comma separated list of floors to visit)
Program performs the math associated with visiting each floor from the comma separated list, outputs the starting floor, floors visited and the total duration to visit each of the floors in the list
Program has an optimized version of algorithm (only valid if all floors are input at start where order can be affected - wanted to show consideration for optimizing visits)

Minimal error handling was added to program.
